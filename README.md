# About React
Created by Facebook in 2013, React is a JavaScript library used for building single-page applications (SPAs), where the user interacts with the page without needing to reload it.

#### Key Features
- **Virtual DOM** - React creates a virtual representation of the DOM and updates only the parts that change, making rendering faster.
- **JSX** - Combines JavaScript with HTML-like syntax for easier UI coding.

# Pre-requisites
React uses JavaScript and therefore React development on Windows requires Node.js and NPM to be installed.

### Node.js
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications. Basically, [Node.js](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-js-windows-setup/) is a JavaScript runtime which makes it possible to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

### npm
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) is a JavaScript package manager. Basically, [node package manager (NPM)](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-js-windows-setup/) is used to install libraries, such as React.js, to your project on the command line.

# Tooling
### Vite
[Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a fast frontend build tool for web development. It consists of a development server, allowing you to run React applications locally.

> [!TIP]
> **vite** has HMR (Hot Module Replacement) built in. HMR lets you update your React components in real-time without reloading the whole page, while keeping your appâ€™s state.
