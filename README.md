# About React
Created by Facebook in 2013, [React](https://react.dev/learn) is a JavaScript library used for building single-page applications (SPAs), where the user interacts with the page without needing to reload it.

#### Key Features
- **Virtual DOM** - React creates a virtual representation of the DOM and updates only the parts that change, making rendering faster.
- **JSX** - Combines JavaScript with HTML-like syntax for easier UI coding.

# Pre-requisites
React uses JavaScript and therefore React development on Windows requires Node.js and NPM to be installed.

### Node.js
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications. Basically, [Node.js](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-js-windows-setup/) is a JavaScript runtime which makes it possible to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

### npm
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) is a JavaScript package manager. Basically, [node package manager (NPM)](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-js-windows-setup/) is used to install libraries, such as React.js, to your project on the command line.

# Tooling
### Vite
[Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a fast frontend build tool for web development. It consists of a development server, allowing you to run React applications locally.

> [!TIP]
> **vite** has HMR (Hot Module Replacement) built in. HMR lets you update your React components in real-time without reloading the whole page, while keeping your app’s state.
	 
### ESLint
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic issues, and code quality problems

### TypeScript
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a superset of JavaScript that adds Type safety resulting in fewer runtime bugs.

How it works is you write TypeScript code in `.ts` files and TypeScript compiles them to regular JavaScript `.js` files.

React normally uses JavaScript (JSX), but with TypeScript (TSX), you get all the typing benefits without giving up JSX.

File Extensions
- `.jsx` → becomes `.tsx` (for components using JSX + TypeScript)
- `.js` → becomes `.ts` (for plain logic or utility files)

# React Components
React components must be in Pascal case i.e. where the first letter of each word starts with an upper case letter. This is because React treats components that begin with a lowercase letter as DOM tags (like `<div>`, `<span>`, etc.). So if a component starts with a lower case React will think it's a native HTML tag.
```JSX
function App() {   // 👈 React components must start with an upper case letter
  return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello React</h1>
      </div>
  );
}

export default App
```
